For File Names:

Header File (include guards): All capital with a _H on the end, e.g., MY_HEADER_H.

For Interface Files:
Prefix: I_
Suffix: Leave empty
After the prefix, use camelCase, starting with an uppercase letter, e.g., I_ExampleInterface

For HAL Drivers:
- prefix: type of drivers exp: io_, com_, cpx_, mem_
Suffix: Leave empty
After the prefix, use camelCase, starting with an uppercase letter, e.g., io_, com_, cpx_, mem_

For Struct Naming (typedef):
Prefix: Leave empty
Suffix: _t
After the suffix, use camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter, e.g., exampleStruct_t

For Enum Naming (typedef):
Prefix: Leave empty
Suffix: _t
After the suffix, use camelCase, starting with a lowercase letter, e.g., exampleEnum_t
With these naming conventions, file names, interface files, HAL drivers, structs, and enums will be more self-descriptive and follow a consistent and readable format.
